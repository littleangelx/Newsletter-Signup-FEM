### What I learned

I initially used percentages for sizing and positioning rather than pixel values. This was because I thought it would be more responsive. However, I later realised that the container has pixel values for size, so using percentages instead of pixel values was pointless. I didn't go back and change them, so there is a mixture of percentages and pixel values.

I learnt how to check if an email address is formatted correctly (to avoid an error).

The subscribe button will fire on either a click or if the user presses the 'Enter' key when in the input box.

### Continued development

I need to practice responsive design.

I need to plan my projects better before starting.
